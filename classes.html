				<p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your
					side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the 
					mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use
					your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your 
					hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.
